# Simple Blog - CRUD

This is my first basic project using Django.  
The goal was to learn how Django works step by step — setting up the project, creating apps, connecting a database, and using templates.

## What this project does
- Basic login and logout
- Simple CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Database connection with SQLite
- Basic HTML templates for pages

## Why I made this
This is a coursework project and a starting point for me to learn Django.  
It is a simple project, but it helped me understand how to structure a Django app and work with its main features.

## What's next
I am currently working on a new project with:
- Better frontend (Bootstrap or Tailwind)
- Search and filter features
- Role-based login (admin and users)
- Cleaner, more user-friendly interface

## How to run
1. **Clone the repository**  
   `git clone https://github.com/husnaien007/DjangoBasics.git`  

2. **Go to the project folder**  
   `cd DjangoBasics`  

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**  
   - Windows: `python -m venv venv` & `venv\Scripts\activate`  
   - Mac/Linux: `python -m venv venv` & `source venv/bin/activate`  

4. **Install dependencies**  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

5. **Apply database migrations**  
   `python manage.py migrate`  

6. **Run the server**  
   `python manage.py runserver`  

7. **Open the app in your browser**  
   Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

✅ **Note:** I renamed the project from `fds_project` to **Simple Blog - CRUD** to make it more descriptive and visually clean.
